## Introduction

Hello, my name is Arvind Ganeshkumar, an aspiring frontend developer! I was able to complete up till Medium without the JWT tokens.

Moreover, for the pagination, I assumed the last_doc_id would be handled and passed in from the frontend. For my GET call I passed in a body with "last_doc"

Thank you!
